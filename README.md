# ApexStreamDisplay
A simple program to display Apex Legends stats in OBS Studio through textfiles.

# Disclaimer
The app will trigger Microsoft SmartScreen. First of all, GitHub’s terms of service is very clear that: "You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature." As a hobbyist programmer, I’m not a verified publisher to Microsoft. This means that Windows Security flags all my applications as potentially dangerous. I have double and triple checked the code and its 100% safe.
